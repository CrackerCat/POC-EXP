SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.2.1 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types. This results in a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability exploitable by users able to configure jobs with the filter, or control the contents of a previously configured jobâ€™s SCM repository.

SCM Filter Jervis Plugin 0.3 configures its YAML parser to only instantiate safe types.
